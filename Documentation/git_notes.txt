Make a new local copy of the remote repository
    $git init
    $git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
    $git pull origin master

Sync your local copy with the remote repository, WITHOUT pushing your changes
    $git pull origin master

Add a new file to the git repository next time you push
    $git add -v path/to/your/file.json

Add all files you have changed [This does not add new files!]
    $git add -uv

Push the changes you've added (this will put them on the remote repository)
    $git commit -m "I changed this stuff!"
    $git push origin master

Overwrite all the changes you've made to your local repository, pulling in the latest version of the remote
    $git reset --hard origin/master
    $git fetch origin master
