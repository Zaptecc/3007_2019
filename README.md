# FRC Team 3007 2019

When trying to upload your contributions use the file update_local_changes.bat if your uploading something ALREADY in the main branch/folder.
when trying to upload files outside the main branch use the file add_file_to_cloud.bat and add its file location Ex. C:/Users/Robotitans/filename/ect.
remember this uploader is relative so it has a sense of where you are.

One thing we dont want is useless commit comments when you use update_local_changes.bat it asks for a message to say why you are uploading/ what it
does, please DO NOT say stupid things that dont relate to it memes,random text,ect remember everyone can see that in the change log and
you cant remove it please keep your stuff school appropriate (people like to see what our code looks like sometimes!)
